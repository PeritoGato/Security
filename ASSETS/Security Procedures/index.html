                            <h4>Why Data Backup is important?</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Backing up data is one of the most effective ways of protecting against data loss.</li>
    <li>A data backup stores a copy of the information on a computer to removable backup media </li>
    <li>Data backups are usually stored offsite to protect the backup media if anything happens to the
        main facility.</li>
        <br>
</ul>
<h3>FILE AND FOLDER PERMISSIONS</h3>
<p> - Permissions are rules you
    configure to limit folder or file
    access for an individual or for a
    group of users.</p>

                                Encryption is where data is transformed using a 
                                complicated algorithm to make it unreadable. 
                                A special key must be used to return the 
                                unreadable information back into readable

                                EFS is directly linked to a specific user account.
                                Only the user that encrypted the data will be 
                                able to access it after it has been encrypted.</p>

                Software tools can be used to recover folders,

            <p class="description">   SSDs are comprised of flash memory instead of magnetic platters. 
                Common techniques used for erasing data such as degaussing are not effective with flash 
                memory. 
                 Perform a secure erase to fully ensure that data cannot be recovered from an SSD and hybrid 
                SSD. 
                Other storage media and documents (e.g., optical disks, eMMC, USB sticks) must also be 
                destroyed. 
                Use a shredding machine or incinerator that is designed to destroy documents and each type of 
                media.
                When thinking about what devices must be wiped or destroyed, remember that devices besides 
                computers and mobile devices store data. 
                Printers and multifunction devices may also contain a hard drive that caches printed or 
                scanned documents. This caching feature can be turned off in some instances, or the device 
                needs to be wiped on a regular basis. </p>
