                            <p class="description"> Computers and workstations should be secured 
                                from theft. 
                                 Lock your workstation when you are not present 
                                to prevent unauthorized users from stealing or 
                                accessing local computer and network 
                                resources.
                                If you must leave a computer in an open public 
                                area, cable locks should be used to deter theft. 
                                 Use a privacy screen to protect the information 
                                displayed on your screen from prying eyes
                                 Access to your computer must also be protected. 
                                 There are three levels of password protection 
                                that can be used on a computer.:</span><br>

                                piece of information and should not be revealed.
                                 Password guidelines are an important 
                                component of a security policy. 
                                 Any user that must log on to a computer or

                                required to have a password. 
                                 Passwords help prevent theft of data and 
                                malicious acts. 
                                 Passwords also help to confirm that the logging

                            <p class="description">   In most networks that use Windows computers, Active Directory is configured with Domains on a

                                Windows computers are members of a domain. 
                                The administrator configures a Domain Security Policy that applies to all computers that join. 
                                Account policies are automatically set when a user logs in to Windows.<br>
                                For stand-alone computers that are not part of an Active Directory domain, the Windows Local 
                                Security Policy can be used to enforce security settings. 
                                To access Local Security Policy in Windows 7 and Vista, use <span>Start > Control Panel > 
                                Administrative Tools > Local Security Policy.</span>

            <p class="description"> A software firewall is a program that provides firewall services on a computer to allow or deny traffic to 
                the computer. A software firewall applies a set of rules to data transmissions through inspection and filtering of 
                data packets. Windows Firewall is an example of a software firewall that helps prevent cybercriminals and malware 
                from gaining access to your computer. It is installed by default when the Windows OS is installed. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>Note:</span> In Windows 10 the Windows Firewall was renamed to Windows Defender Firewall. In this 
                section, Windows Firewall includes Windows Defender Firewall.
                <br>
                <br>
                Windows Firewall settings are configured using the Windows Firewall window. 
                To change Windows Firewall settings, you must have administrator privileges to open the Windows 
                Firewall window. To open the Windows Firewall window, use <span>Control Panel > Windows Firewall.</span>

                notification settings, allow apps through the firewall, configure advanced settings, or restore 
                firewall defaults. If you wish to use a different software firewall, you will need to disable Windows Firewall.

                                would automatically look for a file named <span>autorun.inf</span> and execute it.

                                Newer Windows hosts now use AutoPlay. 
                                AutoPlay provides additional controls and can prompt the user to choose an action based on the 
                                content of the new media.

                     <p class="description"> Web browsers retain information about the web pages that you visit, the searches that you 
                                 perform, andPatches are code updates that manufacturers provide to prevent a newly discovered virus or worm 
                                 from making a successful attack. Manufacturers can combine patches and upgrades into a comprehensive update 
                                 application called a service pack. It is critical to apply security patches and OS updates whenever possible.
                                 Windows routinely checks the Windows Update website for high-priority updates that can help 
                                 protect a computer from the latest security threats. Depending on the setting you choose, Windows automatically
                                downloads and installs any high-priority updates that your computer needs or notifies you as these updates become available.
