                <li>When a malware protection program detects that a computer is infected, it removes or quarantines the threat. However, the computer is most likely still at risk. </li>
                <li>Many antimalware programs can be set to run on system start before loading Windows. </li>
                <li>Removing malware may require that the computer be rebooted into Safe Mode. </li>
                <li>It may be necessary to contact a specialist to ensure that the computer has been completely cleaned. Otherwise, the computer may need to be
                    reformatted, the operating system reinstalled, and your data recovered from the most recent backups.</li>
                <li>The OS system restore service may include infected files in a restore point. Therefore, after a computer has been cleaned of any malware, the system
                    restore files should be deleted.</li>
